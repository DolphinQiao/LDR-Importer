# LDR Importer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/le717/LDR-Importer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/le717/LDR-Importer) #

> A [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org) Importer plugin for the [LDraw Parts Library](http://www.ldraw.org).

LDraw&trade; is an open standard for LEGO CAD programs that allow the user to create virtual LEGO models and scenes. You can use it to document models
you have physically built, create building instructions just like LEGO, render 3D photo realistic images of your virtual models and even make animations.
The possibilities are endless. Unlike real LEGO bricks where you are limited by the number of parts and colors, in LDraw nothing is impossible.

## Updates by [@DolphinQiao](https://github.com/DolphinQiao)
**Object import is now supported and tested for Blender 3.x and 4.x versions. Due to material node system updates in Blender 2.80+, the author [@DolphinQiao](https://github.com/DolphinQiao) has made corresponding modifications to the material components, though these changes remain untested in full.**
